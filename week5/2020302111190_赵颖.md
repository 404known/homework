## 5th homework

### Chapter2 P26:

Suppose Bob joins a BitTorrent torrent, but he does not want to upload any data to any other peers (so called free-riding).

a. Bob claims that he can receive a complete copy of the file that is shared by the swarm. Is Bob’s claim possible? Why or why not?

b. Bob further claims that he can further make his “free-riding” more efficient by using a collection of multiple computers (with distinct IP addresses) in the computer lab in his department. How can he do that?

### solution:

a) Possible,for enough peers staying in the swarm,Bob can receive a complete copy.

b)He can run a client on each host and combine the collected chunks from the differet hosts into a file.By doing that ,he can make his “free-riding” more efficient.



## Chapter2 P28:

Install and compile the Python programs TCP Client and UDP Client on one host and TCP Server and UDP server on another host

a. Suppose you run TCP Client before you run TCP Server. What happens? Why?

b. Suppose you run UDP Client before you run UDP Server. What happens? Why?

c. What happens if you use different port numbers for the client and server sides?



## solution

a) The client try to make a TCP connection but there is no TCP server.So the connection cannot succeed.

b) It will be fine if you run a UDP Client befire Server for ther is no TCP connection with the server.

c) It cannot succeed because the connection is made through the port .
