a. Web sites and client browser  use cookies to maintain some state between transactions
when initial HTTP requests arrives at site, site creates: 
unique ID(aka "cookie") and entry in backend database for ID
  The closing of a connection can be initiated by either the client or the server using the
connection header field. In order for the client to close the connection, the connection
header must include the connection‐token, “close” in the request. If the server wishes
to close the connection, it must include the same “close” token in the connection
header along with its response. This connection header is the last request for that
connection. 
Both the client and server can close a connection.
b. There are no encryption services provided by HTTP.
c. Yes, a client can open three or more simultaneous connections with a given server,
although the suggested number of concurrent persistent connections is two.
d. Closing the connection by one side is possible while the other side is transmitting. This is
because HTTP is stateless and therefore neither party knows the others state.
